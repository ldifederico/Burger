# Burger
Burger is a restaurant application that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. The burger logger uses MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. 

The deployed app is accessible at, https://whispering-dawn-18310.herokuapp.com/. When deployed, the app will display as follows

**Methodology**
Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app displays the burger on the left side of the page. Each burger on the left side is accompanied by a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks `Devour it!`, the burger moves to the right side of the page. Every burger is stored in a database, whether devoured or not.
